## ASP & ANI





## ReCOP

### How to simulate:

1. Change into the directory. 
2. Run the batch file `recop_compile.bat ARG` in command line console. The supported list of `ARG` is : `alu`, `reg_file`, `mux`, `gen_reg`, `data_mem`, `ins_reg`, `recop_datapath`, `recop_control`, `recop`. Argument indicates the part of ReCOP(or the ReCOP itself) that you want to test. (This step assumes that the desktop already has python installed)
3. After compilation, paste the commands into the Modelsim console and enter. 
4. If you encounter `failed to load altera_mf library` error. Execute the `load_lib.do` file by `do load_lib.do`.
